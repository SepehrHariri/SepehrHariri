  I'm a Web Developer.
 </h3>

After a couple of years working as a frontend developer, I started my job as a backend developer two years ago. I have professionally developed various systems with Laravel. Working as frontend developer in different companies and working as a freelance developer have given me priceless experience in HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, Bootstrap, ReactJS, and different plugins of jQuery. I started my backend profession with Laravel 6. As Laravel reached to its 6.7 update, I augmented my abilities respectively. I have also developed my skills in server configuration and MySQL.

Ridesharing apps, central warehouse management, online laundry apps, online clothes store, and personnel management system were some of the projects which I developed their backend, frontend, and dashboard. Standard, developable, and intelligible coding have always been my priorities. I have always done my best to develop flawless web applications.
