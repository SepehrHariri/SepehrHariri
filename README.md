### Hi there, I'm Sepehr ðŸ‘‹

Experienced Web Developer skilled in building robust web applications from scratch, with a strong problem-solving aptitude.
After a few years of working as a backend developer, I started my job as a frontend developer. I have developed various systems with Laravel. Working as frontend developer in different companies and working as a freelance developer have given me priceless experience in ReactJS, TypeScript, NextJS, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, MUI, Bootstrap, jQuery and different plugins of jQuery. I started my backend profession with Laravel. I have also developed my skills in server configuration and MySQL, so that I am being hired as a developer in companies and projects.

Specialized in designing databases and writing efficient SQL queries, enabling streamlined processes and optimized performance. Committed to delivering high-quality solutions and ensuring customer satisfaction, known for attention to detail, effective time management, and consistent adherence to project timelines.

Ridesharing apps, central warehouse management, online laundry apps, online clothes store, and personnel management system were some of the projects which I developed their backend, frontend, and dashboard. Standard, developable, and intelligible coding have always been my priorities. I have always done my best to develop flawless web applications.
